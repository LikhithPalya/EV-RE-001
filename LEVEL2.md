## TASK 1- Build Chassis  

Use any software of your comfort to design a complete chassis of an RC car with dimensions compatible to be printed on the 3D printer available in MARVEL. The chassis should be have a calculated weight distribution depending on the application.

## Task 2 - SPI Communication  

Use any software of your comfort to design a complete chassis of an  RC car with dimensions compatible  to be printed on the 3D printer available in MARVEL. The chassis should be have a calculated weight distribution depending on the application

## Task 3 - I2C Control   

I2C combines the best features of SPI and UARTs. With I2C, you can connect multiple slaves to a single master (like SPI) and you can have multiple masters controlling single, or multiple slaves. This is really useful when you want to have more than one microcontroller logging data to a single memory card or displaying text to a single LCD.

## Task 4 - BMS  

Battery management system (BMS) is technology dedicated to the oversight of a battery pack, which is an assembly of battery cells, electrically organized in a row x column matrix configuration to enable delivery of targeted range of voltage and current for a duration of time against expected load scenarios.
